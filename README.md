A multi-threaded caching proxy created as part of a college project. Works on the Socket and Server-Socket classes. The project includes:

- sending content text / html 
- uploading css content
- uploading js content
- uploading pictures - sometimes images may not load properly.

ATTENTION: This is a project for school that I finished on a laptop on the train. I publish it for people who may have a similar task in the future.
